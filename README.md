# Hashing
This project includes a password storage client that uses a rolling
hash algorithm to encrypt passwords, and stores username-encrypted
password pairs in a text file.

### Installation
Java .jar files are included [here](https://github.com/czeng18/Hashing/tree/master/Hashing/out/artifacts/Hashing_jar) in the repository, which can run in most
OS's.  It may be required to update Java on device, which can be updated
through the [Java website](https://java.com/en/).
This project was built in JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA, so it can be run
alternatively using the IDE.  The IDE can be installed through
the [JetBrains Website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

## Usage
The .jar files can run the programs by opening them.  In IntelliJ, the
runner file is located in the "hashing" package, called "UI".
